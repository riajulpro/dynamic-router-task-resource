    "description": "It all started with our founder, Mr. Shiblu Ahmad. As an experienced engineer, he saw countless talented individuals fail due to inadequate preparation and guidance. He noticed that most training centers sell their courses without providing a practical implementation.",
    "vision": "Mr. Ahmad had a different vision: transforming dreams into reality and giving support every step of the way. TS4U was born to bridge the gap between dreams and reality. Our focus on 'Workforce Readiness' instead of just 'Training' sets us apart from the rest.",
